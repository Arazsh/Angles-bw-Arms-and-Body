# Angles-bw-Arms-and-Torso

In this code, the real-time in browser angle estimation between the left and right arms with the body is implemented. In order to load poseNet, the ml5 is used that is a machine learning library for the web. Also, p5.js is utilized to stream data from webcam, create canvas in the browser, and display the final output, which shows the body skeleton along with the estimated angles between the arms and body. The index.html that contains the implementation is tested for google chrome and Firefox.
